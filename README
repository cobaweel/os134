                         OS 134
**********************************************************************

In bullet points, for the impatient:

   o This is OS 134, a simple kernel for i386 and up PCs

   o To compile, you need GNU gcc and GNU binutils. You also need root
     access on a Linux machine.

   o To run it, you need the qemu PC emulator.

   o We use GNU GRUB, but it is included for you.

OS 134 was (is being) written in 2005 by 

  Jaap Weel, Ting Liao, Benjamin Stein

If you, for whatever reason, have found a use for this piece of
software, we would very much appreciate if you could let us know at
"os134 at ugcs dot caltech dot edu".
