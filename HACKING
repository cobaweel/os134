Here we describe what the various files do. More internals
documentation is found throughout the code in comments, as well as in
the doc/ directory.

asm.S           Boot stub. Very short thanks to GRUB.
multiboot.h     Contains definitions related to GNU Multiboot.
menu.lst        The GRUB menu you see at boot.
layout.ld       The linker map. Tells ld how to lay out the kernel.
kernel.c        Contains main().
run             Runs the kernel in qemu.
std.h           To be included by every .c file. Contains the bounded arrays.
i386.S          Assembly stubs for things C cannot do, to be called from C.
malloc.c        Allocates memory.
segments.c      Sets up the GDT (segment table).
interrupt.c     Sets up the IDT (interrupt table).
handlers.S      Assembly stubs for the interrupt handlers.
util.c          Contains some utility functions. Temporary????

Special, non-interrupt-driven driver:

vga.c           Talks to VGA in text mode.
term.c          "Terminal" (stateful) layer on top of vga.c

Interrupt-driven drivers:

exceptions.c    Handle i386 exceptions.
